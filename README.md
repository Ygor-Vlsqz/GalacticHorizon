Game Concept Document: GalacticHorizon
Overview: GalacticHorizon is a multiplayer, procedurally-generated space strategy game that runs on HuggingFace. Players build and customize ships, explore a vast galaxy, complete missions, engage in tactical battles, and interact with various factions. The game’s visual assets (sprites) are hosted on GitHub and dynamically loaded during gameplay.
Key Features: 
    - Ship Construction: Players can create custom ships from modular parts. Each part has different stats (e.g., hull, power, weapons, mobility).
  - Space Battles: Engage in real-time or turn-based tactical battles against AI or other players. 
  - Missions and Exploration: Navigate a procedurally-generated galaxy filled with missions, secrets, and anomalies.
  - Faction System: Choose to ally with or oppose galactic factions, each with unique traits, benefits, and questlines.
  - Multiplayer: Cooperative and competitive modes. Players can team up for missions or engage in PvP.
  - Procedural Generation: Systems, missions, enemy fleets, and anomalies are procedurally generated for replayability.
Technology Stack: 
  - Frontend: Runs on HuggingFace Spaces using Gradio or Streamlit for the UI.
  - Assets: Sprites stored and versioned in a GitHub repository.
  - Backend: Python-based logic for game state, procedural generation, and multiplayer state handling (via sockets or polling).
  - Data Persistence: Use HuggingFace datasets or an external lightweight DB like TinyDB or Firebase.
Gameplay Loop: 
  - Player logs in or creates a profile.
  - Builds or upgrades their fleet using available resources.
  - Selects missions or explores systems.
  - Encounters battles, makes decisions with faction consequences. 
  - Gains resources, upgrades, and faction standing.
  - Repeats with new challenges and galaxy events each session.
Art Style:
  - Pixel art or vector-based 2D sprites.
  - Retro-futuristic color palette (blues, purples, metallics).
  - Smooth UI with minimalistic overlays and star-map navigation.
Future Plans:
  - Add AI-based NPC interactions using LLMs.
  - Event-based story arcs.
  - User-generated content integration.
Once a ship is completed in-game, it is minted as an NFT. These NFTs are tradable, allowing players to buy, sell, or gift ships. Each ship’s state is persistent:
  - Damage taken, upgrades applied, or battle history are stored in the NFT metadata.
  - Any modification to the ship (positive or negative) is permanent and recorded.
  - NFTs will be managed via a blockchain (e.g., Polygon, Solana, or another cost-effective chain).
  - A smart contract backend will handle minting, ownership, and updates to metadata.
